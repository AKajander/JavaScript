Project_1 Todo page's todos:
There is some incompatibility in naming. When naming ids and classes, you should not use Camel Cases. Separating words with - is the correct naming policy.
Listing tasks and priorities isn't proper function. Adding tasks and priorities into table could be better but a list was a requirement in the assignment.

Project2 Available trains and train schedules page

My plan was to get static train station data and save it into dropdownlist. User could choose departure and arrive stations and I take value of those elements and use it in next call (to get trains that operates between those stations). I get an error that value of a field is null and I can't find a reason for that so that I could fix it. I tested the call with a static parameter and it worked. Then I planned to add a search for trains by date but here is a same problem, I get an error about value being null. So, apparently I can't do anything else but get static meta data.
